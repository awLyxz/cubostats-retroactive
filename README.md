This <a href="https://awlyxz.github.io/cubostats-retroactive/" rel="nofollow">website</a> was made to transfer player stats into the stats of the CuboStats datapack.  
It should be used for servers and single player worlds that had already been played on, if you wish to transfer player stats.  
This process should be a one-time use.
